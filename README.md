# Smart-retail-Product-recommendation
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning-based system for analyzing customer behavior in a retail environment using transactional data. The system combines regression, classification, and clustering techniques to achieve two main goals: personalized product recommendation and customer segmentation.

The dataset is preprocessed to remove anomalies such as returns and missing customer IDs. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals purchasing patterns and high-value customers. A regression model (Linear and Polynomial) predicts customer spending based on purchase behavior. Classification models—including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes—are trained to identify whether customers are likely to purchase specific products like lanterns.

The system also incorporates unsupervised learning techniques such as KMeans, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering to group customers by purchasing behavior. Additionally, a K-Nearest Neighbors approach is applied to recommend products based on similar customer profiles
